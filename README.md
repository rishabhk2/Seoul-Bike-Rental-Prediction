# Seoul-Bike-Rental-Prediction
In this Project, I applied some popular machine learning techniques to the problem of predicting bike rental demand. A data set has been provided containing records of bike rentals in Seoul, collected during 2017-18.
The main aims of the project are:
to practice using tools for loading and viewing data sets;
to visualise data in several ways and check for common pitfalls;
to plan a simple experiment and prepare the data accordingly;
to run your experiment and to report and interpret your results clearly and concisely.
This assignment relates to the following ACS CBOK areas: abstraction, design, hardware and software, data and information, HCI and programming.

A paper that describes one related version of this dataset is: Sathishkumar V E, Jangwoo Park, and Yongyun Cho. 'Using data mining techniques for bike sharing demand prediction in metropolitan city.' Computer Communications, Vol.153, pp.353-366, March, 2020
